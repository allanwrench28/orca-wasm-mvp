deps:
  tbb:
    provides: [scalable_allocator, tbb_set_num_threads, tbb_get_num_threads]
    replaced_by: wasm_shims/oneapi/tbb/* and wasm_shims/tbb/*
    owner: claude
    risk: low
    notes: Simple malloc/free wrapper, no threading in WASM
  
  libslic3r_version:
    provides: [SLIC3R_VERSION, SLIC3R_APP_NAME, etc.]
    replaced_by: wasm_shims/libslic3r/libslic3r_version.h
    owner: claude
    risk: low
    notes: Static version definitions for WASM build
  
  boost_optional:
    provides: [boost::optional, boost::none]
    replaced_by: wasm_shims/boost/optional.hpp
    owner: claude
    risk: low
    notes: Uses std::optional (C++17) as backing implementation
  
  cereal:
    provides: [BinaryOutputArchive, BinaryInputArchive, serialization macros]
    replaced_by: wasm_shims/cereal/*
    owner: claude
    risk: medium
    notes: No-op serialization for WASM, may need real impl for persistence
  
  cgal:
    provides: [Exact_predicates_inexact_constructions_kernel, basic geometry types]
    replaced_by: wasm_shims/CGAL/*
    owner: claude
    risk: high
    notes: Minimal geometry types, may need more complete implementation
  
  openssl:
    provides: [MD5_CTX, MD5_Init, MD5_Update, MD5_Final]
    replaced_by: wasm_shims/openssl/md5.h
    owner: claude
    risk: medium
    notes: Simple hash function, not cryptographically secure
  
  # Future shims as needed:
  opencv:
    provides: [Mat, CV_8UC1, basic image operations]
    replaced_by: wasm_shims/opencv2/*
    owner: TBD
    risk: medium
    notes: Only add what's actually used by Orca
  
  zlib:
    provides: [inflate, deflate]
    replaced_by: miniz (already bundled)
    owner: orca-upstream
    risk: low
    notes: Orca already uses miniz internally

build_notes:
  - All shims use INTERFACE targets to avoid link issues
  - EMSCRIPTEN guards in FindXXX.cmake for native vs WASM builds
  - Global include_directories for shim headers
  - wasm_shims target links to all major targets
